To do:
[ ] check outputs, get flux and energy outputs correct
[ ] fix logging outputs
[ ] double check all math in equations.tex; fix known errors
[ ] test scaling of 2-D FC_poly_Q.py script
[ ] determine: do different matrix solvers speed the problem?
[ ] determine critical R
[ ] confirm that Ma_ad^2 ~ epsilon, Re ~ R

Fixed flux and stress free seem to have unexpected gauge freedoms; understand those and how to add appropriate taus/constraints.  Probably related to translational freedom (stress free) and something about global flux to T? (fixed flux).
